Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Telegram Messaging and User Management System
1. Introduction
   1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements of a Telegram-inspired messaging and user management system. This system enables basic operations on users and their messages through a RESTful API built using Spring Boot, with data persistence in PostgreSQL.
1.2 Scope

The system provides:

    User management (creation, retrieval, deletion)

    Message management (creation, retrieval, deletion)

    RESTful API for interaction with both users and messages

    Authentication for selected endpoints

    DTO usage for API communication

    Basic validation and error handling

1.3 Intended Audience and Usage

This document is intended for developers, testers, and system architects involved in the development, testing, and maintenance of this application.
2. Functional Requirements
   2.1 User Management

   Create a new user

   Retrieve all users

   Retrieve user by ID (requires authentication)

   Delete user by ID

2.2 Message Management

    Create a new message

    Retrieve all messages

    Retrieve message by ID (requires authentication)

    Delete message by ID

2.3 API Endpoints
Message Endpoints (/api/messages)

    GET /get-all-messages – List all messages

    GET /get-message-by-id/{id} – Get a message by ID (authenticated)

    POST /create-message – Create a new message

    DELETE /delete-message/{id} – Delete a message by ID

User Endpoints (/api/users)

    GET /get-all – List all users

    GET /get-by-id/{id} – Get a user by ID (authenticated)

    POST /create-user – Create a new user

    DELETE /delete-by-id/{id} – Delete a user by ID

3. Non-Functional Requirements

   Security: Endpoints for retrieving a single user or message require authentication.

   Performance: The system should be able to handle at least 100 concurrent API requests.

   Maintainability: The code should follow clean architecture principles, using DTOs and services.

   Scalability: The system should be extendable to include features like role-based access or message grouping.

   Documentation: The API will be documented using Swagger/OpenAPI for easy exploration and testing.

4. Data Model
   Entities
   User

   id: Long

   username: String

   email: String

   (Possibly password – if authentication is expanded)

Message

    id: Long

    text: String

    userId: Long (relation to User)

5. Use Cases
   Use Case 1: Creating a User

   Actor: Admin or public client

   Description: Sends a request to create a new user with required details.

   Postcondition: User is saved to the database.

Use Case 2: Fetching All Messages

    Actor: Any client

    Description: The client retrieves a list of all messages.

    Postcondition: A list of messages is returned.

Use Case 3: Authenticated Access to a Specific Message

    Actor: Authenticated user

    Description: Fetches a specific message by ID.

    Postcondition: Returns the message or 404 if not found.

Use Case 4: Deleting a User

    Actor: Admin or system client

    Description: Deletes a user from the system.

    Postcondition: User is removed from the database.

6. Assumptions and Constraints

   No user roles are implemented at this stage (e.g., admin vs. regular user).

   No integration with external Telegram API.

   The application runs locally with H2 for development and PostgreSQL for production.

   Authentication is assumed to be in place but is limited to basic checks (@PreAuthorize).

7. Future Enhancements

   Add role-based access control (RBAC)

   Include authentication with JWT

   Support for updating users and messages

   Implement pagination and filtering

   Integration with actual Telegram Bot API

   Add message timestamps and status fields

8. Glossary

   DTO: Data Transfer Object – simplifies communication between client and server.

   Spring Boot: Framework for building Java web apps.

   PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing application data.

   Swagger/OpenAPI: Tool for documenting RESTful APIs.
